# Multi-Region Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for deploying the Hedge Fund Trading Application across multiple geographic regions to improve global availability, reduce latency, and ensure data sovereignty compliance.

## Architecture Goals

1. **High Availability**: Ensure the application remains available even if an entire region experiences an outage
2. **Low Latency**: Provide fast response times for users regardless of their geographic location
3. **Data Sovereignty**: Comply with regional data residency requirements
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Enable quick recovery from regional failures
5. **Consistent Performance**: Maintain consistent application performance across all regions

## Regional Deployment Strategy

### Primary Regions

We will initially deploy to three primary regions:

1. **North America (us-east-1)**: Primary region for North American users
2. **Europe (eu-west-1)**: Primary region for European users
3. **Asia Pacific (ap-southeast-1)**: Primary region for Asia-Pacific users

### Future Expansion Regions

1. **South America (sa-east-1)**
2. **Australia (ap-southeast-2)**
3. **Middle East (me-south-1)**

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **Static Assets**:
   - Deployed to S3 buckets in each region
   - Distributed via CloudFront CDN with regional edge caching
   - Origin failover configured for high availability

2. **API Gateway**:
   - Regional API Gateway deployments
   - Global DNS with GeoDNS for routing to nearest region
   - Health checks and automatic failover

### Backend Components

1. **Application Services**:
   - Kubernetes clusters in each region
   - Regional autoscaling based on local demand
   - Service mesh for secure cross-service communication

2. **Database Layer**:
   - PostgreSQL with read replicas in each region
   - TimescaleDB with cross-region replication
   - Primary-primary replication for write availability

3. **Caching Layer**:
   - Redis clusters in each region
   - Cross-region cache synchronization for critical data
   - Local-first cache access pattern

### Data Replication Strategy

1. **Database Replication**:
   - Asynchronous replication for global data
   - Synchronous replication for critical data within region
   - Conflict resolution strategies for eventual consistency

2. **User Data**:
   - Primary storage in user's home region
   - Cached copies in other regions with TTL
   - Write-back to home region for persistence

3. **Market Data**:
   - Replicated to all regions for low-latency access
   - Regional ingestion from local data sources
   - Global aggregation for analytics

## Traffic Management

1. **User Routing**:
   - Initial routing based on geographic proximity
   - Automatic failover to next closest region
   - Session affinity for consistent user experience

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Global load balancing with AWS Global Accelerator
   - Regional load balancing with ALB/NLB
   - Health checks with customizable thresholds

3. **Failover Mechanisms**:
   - Automated failover based on health checks
   - Manual failover capability for maintenance
   - Gradual traffic shifting for testing

## Data Sovereignty Implementation

1. **Data Classification**:
   - PII data: Stored only in user's home region
   - Financial data: Replicated globally with encryption
   - Regulatory data: Region-specific storage with access controls

2. **Regional Policies**:
   - EU data: GDPR compliance with data minimization
   - APAC data: Country-specific handling (e.g., Singapore PDP Act)
   - US data: SEC and FINRA compliance

3. **Cross-Region Transfers**:
   - Transfer impact assessments
   - Encryption for data in transit
   - Audit trails for all cross-region data movement

## Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Daily full backups stored cross-region
   - Continuous incremental backups
   - Point-in-time recovery capability

2. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - RTO (Recovery Time Objective): < 1 hour
   - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): < 5 minutes
   - Automated recovery workflows with manual approval gates

3. **Testing**:
   - Monthly DR drills
   - Chaos engineering practices
   - Automated recovery testing

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Global Monitoring**:
   - Centralized logging with regional collection
   - Distributed tracing across regions
   - Global and regional dashboards

2. **Alerting**:
   - Region-specific alert routing
   - Escalation policies based on severity
   - Cross-region correlation for global issues

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Regional latency tracking
   - Cross-region comparison
   - User experience monitoring by region
