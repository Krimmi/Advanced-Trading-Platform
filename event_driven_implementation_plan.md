# Event-Driven & Fundamental Analysis Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Event-Driven & Fundamental Analysis feature will provide tools for analyzing market events and fundamental company data to identify trading opportunities. This feature will integrate with the existing data infrastructure and provide both backend analysis capabilities and frontend visualization components.

## Current Status

This feature has not been implemented yet. We need to build it from scratch, integrating with the existing data infrastructure and frontend components.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Backend Components

#### 1.1 Event Detection System
- Implement event detection models for different event types (earnings, dividends, M&A, etc.)
- Create event classification and prioritization system
- Develop event impact analysis tools

#### 1.2 Fundamental Analysis Engine
- Implement financial ratio calculation module
- Create company valuation models (DCF, multiples, etc.)
- Develop financial statement analysis tools
- Implement growth and profitability trend analysis

#### 1.3 Event-Fundamental Correlation Analysis
- Create tools to analyze correlation between events and fundamental metrics
- Implement statistical significance testing for event impacts
- Develop predictive models for event outcomes based on fundamentals

#### 1.4 API Endpoints
- Create API endpoints for event detection and analysis
- Implement endpoints for fundamental data analysis
- Develop endpoints for combined event-fundamental analysis

### 2. Frontend Components

#### 2.1 Event Dashboard
- Create EventDashboard component
- Implement event timeline visualization
- Develop event filtering and search functionality
- Create event detail view

#### 2.2 Fundamental Analysis Dashboard
- Create FundamentalAnalysisDashboard component
- Implement financial ratio visualization
- Develop company comparison tools
- Create valuation model visualization

#### 2.3 Event-Driven Analysis Tools
- Implement event impact visualization
- Create event-based backtesting interface
- Develop event-driven strategy builder

### 3. Data Integration

#### 3.1 Event Data Sources
- Integrate with financial news APIs
- Implement earnings calendar data source
- Create corporate action data pipeline
- Develop economic calendar integration

#### 3.2 Fundamental Data Sources
- Integrate with financial statement APIs
- Implement company profile data source
- Create industry and sector data pipeline

#### 3.3 Data Processing Pipeline
- Develop event data processing pipeline
- Implement fundamental data normalization
- Create combined event-fundamental data models

## Implementation Order

1. Backend Fundamental Analysis Engine
2. Backend Event Detection System
3. API Endpoints
4. Frontend Fundamental Analysis Dashboard
5. Frontend Event Dashboard
6. Event-Fundamental Correlation Analysis
7. Event-Driven Analysis Tools
8. Data Integration

## Technical Approach

### Event Detection System
- Use natural language processing (NLP) for news event detection
- Implement pattern recognition for technical events
- Create calendar-based event detection for scheduled events

### Fundamental Analysis Engine
- Use industry-standard financial ratio formulas
- Implement multiple valuation models (DCF, multiples, etc.)
- Create peer comparison functionality

### Frontend Visualization
- Use recharts for financial data visualization
- Implement timeline components for event visualization
- Create interactive dashboards with filtering capabilities

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each analysis module
2. Integration tests for data pipelines
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance testing for data-intensive operations
