# Event-Driven & Fundamental Analysis Implementation Next Steps

## Current Status Assessment

We've already implemented several key components of the Event-Driven & Fundamental Analysis feature:

### Backend Components

- [x] Financial statement analysis tools (`financial_analysis.py`)
- [x] Event detection system (`event_detection.py`) - Earnings, Dividends, News, and Technical events

### API Endpoints
- [x] Basic fundamental data endpoints (company profile, financial statements, ratios, etc.)

### Frontend Services
- [x] Basic fundamental data service (`fundamentalService.ts`)
