## Remaining Tasks

### Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend components to backend services
- [ ] Implement proper data flow between components
- [ ] Add event handlers for user interactions

### Testing
- [ ] Create test data for backtesting scenarios
- [ ] Test each component individually
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of the entire workflow
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

### Optimization
- [ ] Review component performance
- [ ] Optimize rendering of data-heavy components
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for historical data

### Documentation
- [ ] Document component APIs
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Update project README with new components

## Next Steps
1. Connect frontend components to backend services
2. Test the integration of all components
3. Optimize performance
4. Create documentation for the Backtesting & Simulation Engine
