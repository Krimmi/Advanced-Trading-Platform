# Cross-Component Integration Plan for Hedge Fund Trading Application

## Component Dependency Analysis

### Key Component Relationships

1. **ML Components and Real-Time Analytics**
   - ML predictions need to feed into real-time analytics dashboards
   - Model performance metrics should update in real-time
   - Feature importance data needs to be accessible across components

2. **WebSocket Service and UI Components**
   - Multiple components subscribe to the same WebSocket streams
   - Potential race conditions when updating shared state
   - Subscription management across component lifecycles

3. **Portfolio Management and Risk Analysis**
   - Portfolio data flows between optimization and monitoring components
   - Risk metrics calculated in one component used in others
   - Position data shared across multiple views

4. **Authentication and Data Access**
   - User permissions affect component visibility and functionality
   - Authentication state impacts data fetching and WebSocket connections
   - Role-based access control for sensitive operations

## Integration Strategies

### 1. State Management Architecture

- **Implement Centralized State Management**
  - Use Redux for global application state
  - Create specialized slices for ML, market data, portfolio, and user settings
  - Implement selectors for efficient data access
  - Add middleware for side effects (WebSocket events, API calls)

- **State Structure**
  ```
  {
    auth: { user, permissions, ... },
    market: { prices, indicators, ... },
    portfolio: { positions, performance, ... },
    ml: { models, predictions, ... },
    ui: { theme, preferences, ... }
  }
  ```

### 2. Event-Based Communication

- **Create Event Bus Service**
  - Implement publish/subscribe pattern for cross-component events
  - Define standard event types and payloads
  - Add event logging for debugging
  - Implement event throttling for high-frequency events

- **Key Events**
  - `MODEL_PREDICTION_UPDATED`
  - `PORTFOLIO_VALUE_CHANGED`
  - `RISK_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED`
  - `MARKET_ANOMALY_DETECTED`

### 3. Shared Service Layer

- **Create Unified Service Interfaces**
  - Implement facade pattern for related services
  - Create service registry for dependency injection
  - Add service proxies for caching and error handling
  - Implement service monitoring

- **Service Coordination**
  - Ensure services use consistent data formats
  - Implement service discovery mechanism
  - Add service health checks
  - Create service-level error handling

### 4. Component Integration Testing

- **Test Component Interactions**
  - Create integration tests for component pairs
  - Test data flow between components
  - Verify event propagation
  - Test error handling between components

- **Test Scenarios**
  - ML model deployment affecting analytics dashboard
  - Portfolio changes triggering risk recalculation
  - Market data updates propagating to all dependent components
  - Authentication changes affecting component access

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

- **Implement Consistent Error Boundaries**
  - Add React error boundaries around key component groups
  - Create standardized error handling for services
  - Implement graceful degradation for component failures
  - Add retry mechanisms for transient errors

- **Error Propagation**
  - Define how errors propagate between components
  - Create error severity levels
  - Implement error aggregation
  - Add user-facing error reporting

### 6. Component API Contracts

- **Define Component Interfaces**
  - Document props and their types
  - Define event emission contracts
  - Specify state dependencies
  - Document side effects

- **Interface Versioning**
  - Track breaking changes in component interfaces
  - Implement backward compatibility where possible
  - Create migration paths for interface changes
  - Document interface evolution

### 7. Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Cross-Component Updates**
  - Minimize prop drilling with context or state management
  - Use memoization for shared calculations
  - Implement efficient data sharing patterns
  - Avoid redundant data fetching across components
