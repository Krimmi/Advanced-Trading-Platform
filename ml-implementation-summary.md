## Technical Details

### Time Series Models

We've implemented two types of deep learning models:

1. **LSTM Model**
   - Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture
   - Multiple LSTM layers with configurable sizes
   - Dropout for regularization
   - Dense layers for final prediction

2. **Transformer Model**
   - Self-attention mechanism for capturing long-range dependencies
   - Multi-head attention for parallel processing
   - Positional encoding for sequence order
   - Feed-forward networks for feature transformation

Both models support configurable hyperparameters, including:
- Lookback window (historical data points)
- Forecast horizon (prediction length)
- Learning rate, batch size, and epochs
- Layer sizes and dropout rates

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Support for multiple data sources (AlphaVantage, Polygon, IEX, Yahoo)
   - Historical and real-time data fetching
   - Configurable data intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, intraday)

2. **Feature Processing**
   - Min-Max scaling for feature normalization
   - Sequence creation for time series modeling
   - Feature selection and target definition
   - Train-test splitting

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Converting raw market data to model-ready format
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Creating sliding windows for sequence prediction

### Model Evaluation

The evaluation framework provides:

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
   - R-squared (coefficient of determination)
   - Direction Accuracy (percentage of correct direction predictions)

2. **Trading Metrics**
   - Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return)
   - Maximum Drawdown (worst peak-to-trough decline)
   - Win Rate (percentage of profitable trades)
   - Total Return (overall performance)

3. **Backtesting**
   - Simulated trading based on model predictions
   - Transaction cost modeling
   - Support for long and short positions
   - Portfolio value tracking

### Model Deployment

The deployment system includes:

1. **Model Registry**
   - Tracking model metadata (type, version, author)
   - Performance metrics storage
   - Hyperparameter tracking
   - Tagging and categorization

2. **Deployment Management**
   - Model loading and unloading
   - Inference API for predictions
   - Usage statistics tracking
   - Model versioning

3. **Inference Pipeline**
   - Data preprocessing for new inputs
   - Model prediction
   - Post-processing of results
   - Confidence intervals and uncertainty estimation

### User Interface

The UI components provide:

1. **Prediction Visualization**
   - Interactive charts for price predictions
   - Historical vs. predicted comparison
   - Multiple timeframe support
   - Multi-asset view

2. **Model Training Interface**
