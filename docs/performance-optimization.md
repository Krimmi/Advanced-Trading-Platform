## Custom Hooks

We've implemented several custom hooks to improve code reusability and performance:

### useWebSocket

A hook for managing WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection capabilities. This hook:

- Handles connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- Provides connection status monitoring
- Implements automatic reconnection with configurable attempts and intervals
- Offers event callbacks for connection events
- Manages message sending and receiving

This hook improves performance by:
- Centralizing WebSocket logic to prevent memory leaks
- Reducing redundant connection attempts
- Providing a consistent interface for real-time data

### useLocalStorage

A hook for persisting state in localStorage with type safety. This hook:

- Synchronizes React state with localStorage
- Handles serialization and deserialization of data
- Provides type safety for stored values
- Listens for changes from other tabs/windows

This hook improves performance by:
- Preventing unnecessary localStorage operations
- Caching values in memory
- Handling storage events efficiently

### useDebounce

A hook for debouncing rapidly changing values. This hook:

- Delays updates until a specified timeout has elapsed
- Prevents excessive re-renders and API calls
- Works with any value type

This hook improves performance by:
- Reducing the frequency of expensive operations
- Preventing UI jank during rapid input changes
- Limiting network requests for search operations

### useIntersectionObserver

A hook for detecting when elements enter or exit the viewport. This hook:

- Uses the Intersection Observer API for efficient detection
- Supports configurable thresholds and root margins
- Provides options for one-time or continuous observation

This hook improves performance by:
- Enabling efficient lazy loading of components and images
- Supporting virtualization and infinite scrolling
- Replacing scroll event listeners with more efficient observers

## Component Optimization

### React.memo

We've applied React.memo to appropriate components to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

- `BacktestResultsViewer` and its child components
- `TabPanel` component
- Chart components that receive stable props
- Table components with potentially large datasets

### Component Structure

We've restructured components to optimize rendering:

- Split large components into smaller, focused components
- Extracted static content to separate components
- Moved expensive calculations outside of render functions
- Used callback and memo hooks for derived values

### VirtualizedTable

We've implemented a virtualized table component that:

- Renders only visible rows for large datasets
- Supports dynamic loading as the user scrolls
- Maintains smooth scrolling performance
- Provides configurable row height and buffer size

## Data Optimization

### Efficient State Updates

We've implemented efficient state update patterns:

- Using functional updates for state that depends on previous state
- Batching related state updates
- Normalizing complex state structures
- Using reducers for complex state logic

### Data Caching

We've implemented data caching mechanisms:

- Caching API responses in memory
- Using localStorage for persistent caching
- Implementing cache invalidation strategies
- Adding service worker caching for offline support

## Rendering Optimization

### Code Splitting

We've implemented code splitting to reduce initial bundle size:

- Created a `lazyLoad` utility for component-level code splitting
- Applied code splitting to route components
- Split large feature modules into smaller chunks
- Implemented retry mechanisms for failed chunk loading

### Lazy Loading

We've implemented lazy loading for:

- Route components
- Large visualization components
- Modal content
- Secondary features

## Offline Capabilities

We've added a service worker that:

- Caches static assets for offline use
- Implements different caching strategies for different resource types
- Handles background sync for offline form submissions
- Manages push notifications
- Provides graceful offline fallbacks

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further optimization:

1. **Web Workers**: Move expensive calculations off the main thread
2. **Shared Workers**: Share WebSocket connections between tabs
3. **IndexedDB**: Use for larger client-side storage needs
4. **Compression**: Compress large datasets before storing
5. **Windowing**: Implement windowing for time-series data
6. **Preloading**: Implement intelligent preloading of likely-to-be-needed resources
7. **Resource Hints**: Add dns-prefetch, preconnect, and preload directives
8. **HTTP/2**: Optimize server for HTTP/2 multiplexing
9. **Image Optimization**: Implement responsive images and modern formats
10. **Font Optimization**: Optimize web font loading and rendering
