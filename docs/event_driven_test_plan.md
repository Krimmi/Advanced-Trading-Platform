| Test data may not cover all edge cases | Medium | Medium | Create comprehensive test data sets, include edge cases in test planning |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Test across all target browsers, use feature detection and polyfills |
| Accessibility requirements may be overlooked | Medium | High | Include accessibility testing from the beginning, use automated tools and manual testing |
| Integration with other features may cause conflicts | Medium | High | Coordinate with other teams, use feature flags, implement integration tests |
| Performance degradation with large datasets | High | Medium | Test with realistic data volumes, implement pagination and lazy loading |
| Test automation may be brittle | Medium | Medium | Use stable selectors, implement retry logic, maintain test code quality |
| Time constraints may limit testing coverage | Medium | High | Prioritize test cases, focus on critical functionality, automate repetitive tests |
| UI changes may break tests | High | Medium | Use resilient selectors, separate UI tests from logic tests, update tests with UI changes |
